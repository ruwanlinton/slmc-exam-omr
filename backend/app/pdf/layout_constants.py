OMR Answer Sheet Layout Constants (A4 @ 300 DPI canonical space)

All measurements in millimeters unless noted.
A4: 210mm x 297mm  →  at 300 DPI: 2480px x 3508px

The PDF uses ReportLab points (1pt = 1/72 inch).
A4 in points: 595pt x 842pt

These constants define positions in millimeters from top-left of the page.
The OMR pipeline uses the same constants mapped to the canonical 2480x3508 pixel space.
